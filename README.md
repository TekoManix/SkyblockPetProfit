The first version of the project! This is a personal project I wanted to work on, but due to how Hypixel's developer API works now, I have to commit the project to GitHub so Hypixel doesn't think I'm not doing anything malicious :/

Basic rundown of this program is to track the best pets to level up and sell at level 100 in Skyblock (if that wasn't obvious)

I'm bit of a newbie in coding, so if there's anything I should do to improve or anything wrong with my code, let me know! Instagram and Discord are both TekoManix, so shoot me a message there, or email me at 
tekomanixbusiness@gmail.com.
